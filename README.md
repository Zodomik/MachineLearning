In this notebook we try to practice all the classification algorithms.

We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.

This dataset is about past loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted.

Then use the test set to report the accuracy of the model You should use the following algorithm:

K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression


Report
You should be able to report the accuracy of the built model using different evaluation metrics:

Algorithm   	--  Jaccard -- F1-score --	LogLoss
KNN	                ?	          ?           NA
Decision Tree	      ?	          ?	          NA
SVM	                ?	          ?           NA
LogisticRegression  ?	          ?	          ?
